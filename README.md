|------|---------|-------|  
| [**Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB)**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CK2FCG1K?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) | Latest model with better performance.<br>⚠️ If you get the Pi 5, active cooling is recommended.<br>Raspberry Pi 4 also works well if you want to save some money. | **~$80** |  
| [**Power Cord**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ2DL2RW?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title) | Reliable USB-C power supply.<br>Many options will work, but this is the one I use. | **~$10** |

**Total Estimated Cost:** ≈ **$115**

### 🏡 Architecture

The below is a basic representation of my Home Assitant setup. I have a router dedicated to devices that don't require internet access to keep as much activity private as possible. I also have Zwave set up and prefer that configuration to boost performance as new devices are added.
